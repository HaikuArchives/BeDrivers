ES18xx Sound Driver v0.42a

28th November, 2000

This is a sound driver for ES18xx based cards. It is believed to work with the 1868, 1869, 1878, and 1879 chipsets.
 
This driver is based on Joseph Wang's Audio Drive driver, and Fernando Francisco de Oliveira's modifications to it in his ES 1869 driver. If you are using either of these drivers you should expect similar functionality.

User's of Audio Drive who have had initialisation problems may find that the problem has been resolved.

The driver has been tweaked so that it is less likely to have audio glitches when playing multiple streams simulataneously or on a heavily loaded system. I would like to hear from people whether this is indeed the case, especially user's of Audio Drive and the ES1869 driver. Please include your CPU speed in your report.

The installation will prompt you to remove the third party Audio Drive (Joseph Wang), ES1869 (Fernando Francisco de Oliveira), and Sound Blaster Pro (Joseph Wang) drivers on your system.

Anyone who wishes to further develop the driver is welcome to take up the cause.

Versions
0.42a - integrated synchronization related changes from the ES1969 driver. Changed SNTIME to  500ms to improve performance.

Installation
Double click on the file "install".  This will copy the driver the "~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin" and
link this to "~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/audio/raw" and "~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/audio/old".  If you have a version of the sound blaster pro driver, it will ask if you want to deinstall the sound blaster pro driver (recommended if you are replacing your driver).

Bugs
Playback and CD-ROM support only.
Sound Distortion
The installer may not work if you have already installed another driver in which case you should reboot.
