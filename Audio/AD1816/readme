AD1816(A) audio-driver for the Be Operating System R4 (and later).

(C) 1998-2001 Jens Winkler <jwin@gmx.net>

Notes for the experimental AD1816A-driver:

- to install the driver run the "install.sh"-script,
- to uninstall the "uninstall.sh" script.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if you update from a pre-1.1a version, you have to rerun
the "install.sh"-script to activate midi support
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This driver should work with any PnP ISA soundboard that is
based on the Analog Devices AD1816 chipset. It only checks
for the logical device id, so it should be vendor-independent.

This software is an experimental release.
No responsibility is taken for any part of the software or any harm
it might do to your system.

Known limitations:
- single dma mode is not (and will most certainly never be) supported
- only one card is supported (due to lack of hw resources on PC MBs having
  more than one AD1816 card is out of the question)

History:

changes in release 1.3:
- fixed serveral SMP related bugs in the isr
- fixed jitter correction for capture
- removed spinlocks from transfer startup code

changes in release 1.2:
- capture was broken with BeOS R5 - fixed
- configuration and register locks are now Benaphores
- changed the link names of the driver from 'ad1816' to
  'ad1816/1' to comply with the Be naming convention
- correct sample time with interrupt latency to
  compensate for jitter

changes in release 1.1a:
- fixed broken midi-link in the install-script
  (thanks to Florian Faber for pointing this one out)

changes in release 1.1:
- added support for the midi port (BeOS 4.5 and later)
- fixed broken capture support
- fixed a bug which leads to 'crunchy' sound after doing
  'Restart Media Services'
- removed unused sample-format conversions
- cleanups in init/pnp code
- inline assembly memcpy() uses mmx if supported

changes in release 1.0i:
- changed the playback code to do just doublebuffering (for latency
  reasons) instead of prefetching up to 8 buffers 
- changed size of dma buffers to 4k
- fixed a bug in the buffer size negotiation code to make it work with
  the upcoming 4.5 (aka genki) release
- removed unused 8237 register definitions
- appended ".sh" to the script names to avoid confusion with the 
  equally named "install" and "uninstall" command-line programs

changes in release 1.0h:
- fixed a minor bug in the ISR which caused system beeps not being
  played correctly
- several cleanups in pnp code

changes in release 1.0g:
- first public release with source code included
- fixed several bugs with calculating the correct "sample_clock"
  values (this was undocumented in the R4 BeBook...) 

before 1.0g:
- binary release only
- "beta" status
