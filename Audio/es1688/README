ESS 1688 Sound Driver v0.43
Stefan Werner <stefan@keindesign.de>
13.3.2001

This is a Sound driver for the ESS 1688 AudioDrive Chip in my ThinkPad 365XD running
BeOS R5. I did not test it on any other machines, so I hope you can give me some feedback.
Currently it doesn't do more than play 44.1kHz 16 bit stereo sound - sometimes. It doesn't
provide recording or MIDI functionality yet. It has a quite bad performance on my TP,
playing mp3 in CL-Amp takes all the CPU (Pentium 120MHz) and sometimes it stutters
or even remains completely silent. Looks like the IRQ-Handler skips some IRQs...

This driver is basically a slightly modified ESS18xx driver from Paul Yu, that's why
I decided to put the original ReadMe file below and use the same verson number.

Version 0.43, first public release

ES18xx Sound Driver v0.43
Paul Yu <pcky@bigpond.com>
28th November, 2000

This is a sound driver for ES18xx based cards on the BeÂ® Operating System. It is believed to work with the 1868, 1869, 1878, and 1879 chipsets.
 
This driver is based on Joseph Wang's Audio Drive driver. The driver had an initialisation problem that was introduced when the driver was updated. I merely put some code from a previous version back into the driver.

The installation will prompt you to remove the third party Audio Drive (Joseph Wang), ES1869 (Fernando Francisco de Oliveira), and Sound Blaster Pro (Joseph Wang) drivers on your system.

Anyone who wishes to further develop the driver is welcome to take up the cause.

Versions
0.43 - synchronized with 0.41a and replaced code relating to write_state in pcm.c from 0.22a
0.42a - essentially version 0.22a with SNTIME of 500ms

Audio Drive Driver v0.41a

Installation
Double click on the file "install".  This will copy the driver the "~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin" and
link this to "~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/audio/raw" and "~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/audio/old".  If you have a version of the sound blaster pro driver, it will ask if you want to deinstall the sound blaster pro driver (recommended if you are replacing your driver).

Bugs
Playback and CD-ROM support only.
Sound Distortion
The installer may not work if you have already installed another driver in which case you should reboot.
